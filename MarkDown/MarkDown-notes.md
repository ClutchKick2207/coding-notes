# Some info on MarkDown before I begin:
Markdown is the most popular markup language used to make all sorts of things, such as e-mails, essays, and other documents. It is completely open-source, and also does not lock you into any specific editor or file format. It can be used on any OS, through applciations made purely for it, and also through editors through extensions. It can also use HTML snippets to allow for some extensibilty. If you want some serious horsepower for graphs, and other tools, use RMarkDown, which integrates R into the MarkDown process. I'll probably dabble into that if I ever need to use some serious graphing.

## Why MarkDown?
This is a question that I have been asking myself for a bit, but it allows for a distraction free way to write down something quickly, and make it look aesthetically pleasing. It can then be exported into a document that can be shared easily (such as a PDF)
