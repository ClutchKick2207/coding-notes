# Some info on MarkDown before I begin:
Markdown is the most popular markup language used to make all sorts of things, such as e-mails, essays, and other documents. It is completely open-source, and also does not lock you into any specific editor or file format. It can be used on any OS, through applciations made purely for it, and also through editors through extensions. It can also use HTML snippets to allow for some extensibilty. If you want some serious horsepower for graphs, and other tools, use RMarkDown, which integrates R into the MarkDown process. I'll probably dabble into that if I ever need to use some serious graphing.

## Why MarkDown?
This is a question that I have been asking myself for a bit, but it allows for a distraction free way to write down something quickly, and make it look aesthetically pleasing. It can then be exported into a document that can be shared easily (such as a PDF). This can also be done to make efficient notes (through applications such as Notion, as well as your editor of choice and Git).

# A Guide to MarkDown
Now I will break down the basics of MarkDown, and who knows, maybe I'll throw in some cool stuff as well.

<br>

## Using HTML:
Throughout this document, you may have seen some HTML, such as `<br>`. Different rendering engines will render this differently, but GitHub's and many others, will have syntax highlighting enabled. To activate this, write the name of the programming language with the opening part, like below

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

<br>

## The Different Headings:
These headings can be used to signify different levels (such as points, sub-points, chapters, etc.)

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4

<br>

## **Bold** and _italics_:
To **Bold** a phrase/sentence but '**' infront and behind the piece of text. To use _italics_ put underscores infront and behind the text. You can also do both simultaneously, such as **_Bold and Italic_**, by just adding in both.

## Different Lists:
Lists are often used in MarkDown during note-taking, and can be beneficial to summarize any points.
### Unordered Lists:
- This is a list , it is cool
- This is also unordered, and uses bullet points
