# **What this is about:**

 This is a project to put all of my notes from all of my studied languages into this repository so that it can be accessed at any time. 

# **How you can help:**

You can email me your notes (in a .txt file format), to be added to this repository, and lets make this a one-stop shop for all the documentation and coding help that you may need!

# **Languages:**

* PHP
* Python
* Swift
* MarkDown

I will add in here any notes that I may have about programming, and I will be sure to keep this updated.
